OPERATOR OVERLOADING:
WHEN THE OPERATOR GIVES MORE FUNCTIONALITY IT IS CALLED OPERATOR OVERLOADING

eg:
System.out.println("a"+"b");  //op : ab

we know that + operator is used for adding 2 numers , but here java has given us other fucntionality that we can 
concinate 2 strings as wellm. this is called as operator overloading.

this exception is only on strings .

in c++ and python operator overloading is highly supported but in java it is not because it results in poor coding .

EXCEPTION:
IN JAVA + IS THE ONLY OPERATOR THAT IS INTENTIONALLY OVERLOADED TO SUPPORT STRING CONCATINATION
